/*
 * Each queue created (for read) or opened (for write) is represented

 *
 * For read queues, a messageType is mapped to a jump_message_queue by
 * keeping a copy of the messageType in the jump_message_queue,
 * keeping the jump_message_queues in a doubly-linked list, and
 * searching the list.  The list is self-organizing: get_message_queue
 * moves each jump_message_queue it returns to the front of the list.
 * The prev/next pointers are built in to struct jump_message_queue to
 * make things simple.  FIXME: A hash table would be better, but it's
 * not clear whether hsearch_r is available and I don't want to write
 * one.
 *
 * For write queues, only the fd field is used, but using
 * jump_message_queue for both read and write queues allows the
 * create/destroy code to be reused easily.  NOTE: there's not much
 * reuse, so maybe a write queue should just be an fd and the
 * open/close code should be refactored.
