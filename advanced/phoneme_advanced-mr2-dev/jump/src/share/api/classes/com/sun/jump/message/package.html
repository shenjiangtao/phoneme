  This package consists of the JUMP messaging abstractions. Every component
  that runs on a seperate process contains a single <code>JUMPMessageQueue</code>
  which is used to send/receive messages to/from other components.
  {@link com.sun.jump.executive.JUMPExecutive} hosts the message queues for the
  executive and {@link com.sun.jump.isolate.jvmprocess.JUMPIsolateProcess} 
  hosts the message queues for the isolate instance.
