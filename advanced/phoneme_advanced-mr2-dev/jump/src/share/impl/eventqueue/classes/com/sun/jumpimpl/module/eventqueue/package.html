  This package contains the initial implementation of the <b>EventQueue</b> 
  executive module. It uses a single queue for all events and a single 
  processing thread, from the context of which all event handlers are 
  executed. No threads use active polling for the events, i.e. all the 
  threads in this module are blocked if the underlying platform does not 
  generate any events.

  <p>
  When a new native event arrives, the receiving thread wakes up, enqueues 
  the event data and causes the processing thread to wake up. The processing 
  thread gets the event from the queue and tries to find a registered handler 
  for this type of events. If a handler is found, the corresponding event 
  handler is executed.

  <p>
  The internal logic of event handlers is completely up to JSRs. However, 
  their lengthy execution can affect the event system itself 
  (by delaying the next event being retrieved from the queue), so potentially 
  slow or blocking event handlers should use another thread for processing 
  and return as soon as possible.
